# unifi
Unifi is a liquidity manager for Uniswap v3. The aim is to provide an augmented feature set on top of the versatility of Uniswap v3.

# Minimum Viable Product
The aim to deliver a first version which is both usable and provide a minimal functionality. The first version will be composed of:

1. A front-end webapp
2. A solidity contract (the liquidity manager?)

# Platforms and languages
- React
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (to get started?)
- [Solidity 0.8.5](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/)
- [Uniswap SDK](https://docs.uniswap.org/SDK/)

# Infinite Possibilities (idea dump)

- Provider simple templates that automatically follow the market ranges
- Use bollinger bands to re-target liquidity ranges
- Allow providers to express a market view while being makers
